#Global JavaScript Viewer 1.0.1

##All of the Javascript on your page, *simplified*.

### It's the ultimate plugin for viewing and breaking down the JavaScript on your website.

### Why should I use this script viewer?

* Overview of the status of JS on every page.
* Sums up the location of all scripts in the document.
* Insight into which scripts are third party.
* Know which / when scripts were injected into the page.
* Know which / when scripts were removed from the page.
* It's as easy as a Chrome Extension.
* Or it can be bound to debug scripts as you please.
